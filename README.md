* üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Nicolas Lo√Øc Pierre DESENY, aka @NickTheDowser

Born on May 11, 1983, I'm a software engineer and CEO of Aspermind Studio. My background is rich and varied, touching on software development, the cultural scene and technological innovations. I'm an amateur guitarist, a psychologist in my spare time, and absolutely deplorable at trading... In short, I'm a resolutely non-standard individual.

** Experiences and achievements

*** French Amstrad CPC Demo-making scene (1997 - 2001)

As an active member of the Demo scene under the pseudonym Blood, within the Da Boxon Team (DBT) group, I helped encourage (from quite a distance, I must admit) the creative evolution of the Amstrad CPC community.

*** Creator of the fanzine ‚ÄúThe Amstrad Survivor‚Äù (1998 - 2001)

I founded and edited The Amstrad Survivor fanzine, a publication dedicated to the world of Amstrad CPC computers, and designed to inform and entertain enthusiasts in the community.

*** Creator of the online game ‚ÄúColony Zero‚Äù (2006 - 2007)

In 2006, I created the PBEM game Colony Zero. At its peak, it had over 10,000 active players. It has been made in PHP/MySQL. It was a real good experience and it helped me to learn web developpement.

*** Founder of @Aspermind studio Company

On February 1, 2013, I founded Aspermind Studio, initially as a micro-enterprise (Mr Nicolas DESENY EI). In November 2024, the company became a SARL with variable capital of ‚Ç¨10,000, dedicated to the development of innovative software for the video game industry.

*** Creator of the ‚ÄúRDVI‚Äù plug-in for IT-CE (2013)

In April 2013, I developed the RDVI plug-in for the MySys information system used by the BPCE banking group. This tool optimized the management of real estate loans, significantly reducing processing time on a national scale.

*** Development of ‚ÄúUnilang‚Äù for Unity (2016)

I designed Unilang, a software brick dedicated to the linguistic and cultural localization of video games developed under the Unity engine. Unilang facilitates the integration of multiple languages and cultural customization, simplifying the adaptation of games for different markets.

*** Creation of the ‚ÄúGJ France‚Äù mobile application (2018)

In 2018, under a pseudonym, I developed the GJ France mobile app, which enabled injured protesters to get emergency medical help via a network of ‚ÄúStreet Doctors‚Äù. The app also counted participants in protests.

*** Creation of ‚ÄúTally WPF‚Äù - a generative AI (2024)

In June 2024, I created Tally WPF, a generative AI in C# WPF for Aspermind Studio. Working on the principle of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with a perceptron, large language model (LLM), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and diffusion models, Tally WPF is designed to assist Aspermind collaborators in their daily tasks.

*** Co-creator and co-host of ‚ÄúGameDev Talk‚Äù (2024)

On October 25, 2024, we'll be launching GameDev Talk, a talk show broadcast on YouTube and as a podcast on Spotify, offering an insider's perspective on the video game industry. With my co-host Jean-Yves, we discuss industry news, trends and technical issues.
